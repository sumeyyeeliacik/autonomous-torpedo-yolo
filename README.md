# Autonomous Torpedo System with YOLO

This project is part of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) developed by our student robotics team. It implements an AI-based torpedo system using real-time object detection with a YOLOv5 model in ONNX format. Once a circular target is detected and aligned, the system executes a simulated torpedo launch based on decision logic.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv5 (ONNX).
- Python-based control logic using OpenCV and DNN module.
- Underwater navigation and target tracking.
- Conditional torpedo activation after alignment and size verification.
- Search, align, and fire behavior implemented with logic layers.
